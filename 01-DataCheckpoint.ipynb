    "It is an important topic in environmental and public health research for long-term exposure to\n",
    "fine particulate matter (PM2.5). PM2.5 is defined as airborne particles with a diameter of 2.5\n",
    "micrometers or smaller. These particles are small enough to be inhaled deep into the lungs. So\n",
    "PM2.5 has been widely studied for its potential effects on respiratory and cardiovascular health.\n",
    "Many studies focus on long-term exposure, which better represents chronic environmental\n",
    "conditions, not short-term pollution events. \n",
    "\n",
    "Large-scale epidemiological research showed that populations living in areas with higher levels\n",
    "of air pollution experienced higher mortality rates, even after accounting for other factors. This\n",
    "work helped establish air pollution as a serious public health concern and motivated later studies\n",
    "that focused more specifically on fine particulate matter, such as PM2.5. More recent review\n",
    "papers summarize decades of research and conclude that long-term exposure to PM2.5 is\n",
    "consistently associated with negative health outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the county level, studying PM2.5 requires reliable exposure data that can be compared across\n",

    "gridded air pollution data to county boundaries, making it possible to calculate long-term\n",
    "average PM2.5 exposure for each U.S. County. The CDC Environmental Public Health Tracking\n",
    "program also identifies outdoor air quality as a key environmental factor linked to respiratory\n",

    "We hypothesize that U.S. counties with higher PM2.5 levels (as measured by the County Health Rankings “Air Pollution: Particulate Matter” raw value) will have higher adult COPD prevalence and higher adult current asthma prevalence, even after controlling for adult smoking prevalence and county-level covariates (demographics, socioeconomic status, urbanicity, and healthcare access).\n",

    "Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) can penetrate deep into the respiratory system and is plausibly linked to chronic respiratory conditions. In this project, we use county-level PM2.5 values from the County Health Rankings (Air Pollution: Particulate Matter raw value) and county-level respiratory outcome estimates (adult COPD prevalence and adult current asthma prevalence) from CDC PLACES. We test whether counties with higher PM2.5 also show higher respiratory disease burden at the population level, while adjusting for smoking and key county characteristics. Because all measures are aggregated to the county level, the analysis identifies ecological associations and does not by itself establish individual-level causality."

    "### Data overview\n",
    "\n",
    "To study whether higher multi-year average PM<sub>2.5</sub> predicts higher adult COPD and asthma prevalence (by county) while controlling for other factors, we would construct an ideal dataset with Each County contains the following features. And we plan to collect 5 to 10 year datasets:\n",
    "- Air Pollution Exposure: Multi-year average annual PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration (µg/m³) for each county.\n",
    "- Health Outcomes: Adult COPD prevalence (%) and adult current asthma prevalence (%) for the corresponding time period. These would ideally be age-adjusted prevalence estimates of diagnosed COPD and current asthma among adults (18+).\n",
    "\n",
    "We also have a set of comprehensive covariates for each county, including:\n",
    "- Smoking Rate: Adult smoking prevalence (%) as smoking is a major COPD risk factor.\n",
    "- Demographics: Population age distribution (e.g., % of population over 65), sex distribution, and racial/ethnic composition of the county. These factors control for population differences that affect disease prevalence.\n",
    "- Socioeconomic Factors: Indicators such as median household income, poverty rate, education level (% high school graduates), and unemployment rate. These help control for social determinants of health that could confound the pollution-health relationship.\n",
    "- Urbanicity: A measure of how urban or rural the county is (for example, a rural–urban continuum code from USDA). Urban counties may have different pollution levels and health care access than rural ones, so this needs to be accounted for.\n",
    "- Healthcare Access: Metrics reflecting access to care, such as the number of primary care physicians per 100,000 population or the percentage of adults without health insurance. This controls for differences in medical diagnosis and management of COPD/asthma across counties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of Observations: Ideally, all counties in the U.S. (≈3,142 counties) would be included to maximize statistical power and generalizability. Each county would be one observation (a cross-sectional dataset), since we are examining multi-year average exposure and current outcomes. If a panel design were considered, we could have multiple observations per county over time, but the question’s focus on a multi-year average suggests a single observation per county (using recent 5–10 year data). Thus, roughly 3,000+ observations would be needed, covering the entire United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Collection Methods: In an ideal scenario, all variables would be measured consistently over the same multi-year period\n",
    "\n",
    "- PM<sub>2.5</sub> Data Collection: Fine particulate pollution levels would come from a combination of ground monitors and satellite-derived models to ensure every county has an estimate. For example, the EPA’s Air Quality System monitors and modeled data (like CDC’s Environmental Public Health Tracking network) could provide daily PM<sub>2.5</sub> values, which are then averaged to an annual mean for each year and further averaged over 5+ years. This yields a stable multi-year mean for each county.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Health Outcomes: COPD and asthma prevalence data would come from large health surveys (such as CDC’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System) analyzed with small-area estimation techniques. A model-based approach can produce county-level prevalence estimates for COPD and asthma by combining survey data with census population characteristics. This was done, for instance, in CDC’s PLACES project, which provides county estimates for chronic diseases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Smoking and Other Covariates: These would be collected from reliable national sources. Smoking rates and other health behavior data could also come from CDC survey estimates (e.g., BRFSS via PLACES). Demographic and socioeconomic variables come from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS), which continuously collects data on population characteristics in every county. Urban/rural status can be assigned from USDA classifications, and healthcare access metrics can be obtained from health resource databases (e.g., HRSA’s Area Health Resources File). Each of these data sources covers all U.S. counties consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Organization: All the above data would be merged into one cohesive dataset keyed by a common identifier for counties (such as the 5-digit FIPS code). Each row would represent one county, and columns would include the PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure, health outcomes, and control variables. The data could be stored as a spreadsheet or CSV file, or in a relational database. For example, one might use a table with columns: County_FIPS, County_Name, State, PM25_avg, COPD_prev, Asthma_prev, Smoking_rate, Median_income, Poverty_rate, RUCC_code, PrimaryCarePhysicians_per100k, etc. This organized format makes it easy to run statistical analyses. We would ensure that the time frames align (e.g., pollution averaged over 2015–2019 and COPD/asthma prevalence around 2019–2020) so that the exposure precedes or coincides with the health outcome measurement. In summary, the ideal dataset includes all U.S. counties with a comprehensive set of variables collected over the last 5–10 years, cleaned and combined into a single analysis file.\n",

    "Instructions: \n",
    "1. Change the header from Dataset #1 to something more descriptive of the dataset\n",
    "2. Write a few paragraphs about this dataset. Make sure to cover\n",
    "   1. Describe the important metrics, what units they are in, and giv some sense of what they mean.  For example \"Fasting blood glucose in units of mg glucose per deciliter of blood.  Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",
    "3. Use the cell below to \n",
    "    1. load the dataset \n",
    "    2. make the dataset tidy or demonstrate that it was already tidy\n",
    "    3. demonstrate the size of the dataset\n",
    "    4. find out how much data is missing, where its missing, and if its missing at random or seems to have any systematic relationships in its missingness\n",
    "    5. find and flag any outliers or suspicious entries\n",
    "    6. clean the data or demonstrate that it was already clean.  You may choose how to deal with missingness (dropna of fillna... how='any' or 'all') and you should justify your choice in some way\n",
    "    7. You will load raw data from `data/00-raw/`, you will (optionally) write intermediate stages of your work to `data/01-interim` and you will write the final fully wrangled version of your data to `data/02-processed`\n",
    "4. Optionally you can also show some summary statistics for variables that you think are important to the project\n",

    "This dataset provides county-level health estimates produced by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s PLACES program. The measures we use are adult COPD prevalence (%), adult current asthma prevalence (%), and adult current cigarette smoking prevalence (%). Values are reported in percent (%) and come with 95% confidence intervals (low/high confidence limits), which reflect estimation uncertainty. The PLACES 2025 release is based on updated Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data (mostly 2023 BRFSS).\n",
    "\n",
    "Important interpretation note: these are model-based small-area estimates rather than direct measurements for every county. That makes them useful for nationwide county comparisons, but it also means the values can be influenced by the modeling approach and the underlying survey coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Major concerns / limitations: (1) Ecological inference—relationships at the county level don’t automatically imply individual-level causal effects. (2) Measurement error and uncertainty—especially for small counties; some county values may be missing/suppressed. (3) Time alignment—PLACES outcomes reflect BRFSS-based estimates for specific years; we should align the PM2.5 exposure window as closely as possible when we build the final merged dataset.\n"

    "\n",
    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "> We considered that not every county has the same number of air quality monitoring stations during data collection. This could introduce bias because there are fewer PM2.5 monitoring stations in rural areas and more in urban areas.\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "> Both EPA monitoring stations and the CDC collect county level data that does not include personal identifying information, such as names or precise addresses, so the privacy risk is extremely low.\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "> To mitigate potential downstream biases, we considered incorporating a range of protective variables, such as race, income, and education level, rather than focusing solely on PM2.5 concentrations. In this way, we identified potential environmental injustices, reflecting the distribution of polluting infrastructure across different communities in the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "> Although the raw data is publicly available, our data cleaning and tables are securely stored in a private Github repository, accessible only to team members and relevant faculty. Furthermore, by using Git, we can track who modified the data. This not only ensures data security during the analysis process but also prevents data from being corrupted.\n",
    " - [ ] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    ">Our data will only be used during the project period in the Winter 2026 quarter, and will be deleted or archived after the grading is completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "> Our analysis focuses primarily on outdoor PM2.5 concentrations, but our county level environmental data cannot capture factors affecting indoor air quality, such as household dust or workplace secondhand smoke, which contribute to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma.\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "> We identified detection bias, meaning that not being diagnosed by a doctor doesn't necessarily mean not being sick. In counties with limited access to healthcare, despite people being exposed to high concentrations of PM2.5, the diagnosis rate of respiratory diseases is low, leading to data that falsely suggests that poorer counties are healthier than they actually are. To address this detection bias, we will incorporate income as a factor to adjust these underestimated figures back to their true levels.\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "> In this project, to ensure that our charts and statistics accurately reflect the data, we will maintain integrity by avoiding misleading presentations, including outliers, and avoiding truncated axes, etc.\n",
    " - [ ] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "> Our analysis is fully documented in Jupyter Notebooks, and the use of Git ensures that all modifications are recorded. Furthermore, we have listed all data sources to facilitate verification by the TA and ensure the reproducibility of our work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "> We understand that the variable of income might be misinterpreted as being linked to discrimination, but in our project, it is simply a factual statement reflecting the unfairness of social structures, and not intended to discriminate against any particular group.\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "> We will test whether the model performs as accurately in impoverished counties as it does in wealthy counties. If the model makes more errors in impoverished areas, we will honestly report this in our report and explain the reasons.\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "> We will use various metrics to evaluate the model. For example, we will look at R² to understand the extent of air pollution's impact on asthma.\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "> Linear regression clearly shows the meaning of each number, which makes it easy to explain, for example, how much the asthma rate changes when PM2.5 levels increase.\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "> We will include a \"Limitations\" section in the project and honestly state that this analysis primarily focuses on the relationship between air pollution and respiratory health, but does not consider other factors such as family genetics.\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "> Our results are based on past data, so we would like to remind viewers that this data may need to be updated if future air pollution patterns change.\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "> If we find that our analysis might mislead others, we will immediately update the content. We will also include a disclaimer stating that this is a school project and does not constitute any medical advice or policy recommendations.\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    "> We use Git to manage our projects, and if we find any incorrect analysis or faulty code, we immediately go back to the appropriate version.\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "> To prevent unintended use, we will add a disclaimer explaining that our project only shows correlation, not causation. In other words, for example, the fact that there are more cases of asthma in areas with poor air quality does not mean that poor air quality causes asthma."

    "Read over the [COGS108 Team Policies](https://github.com/COGS108/Projects/blob/master/COGS108_TeamPolicies.md) individually. Then, include your group’s expectations of one another for successful completion of your COGS108 project below. Discuss and agree on what all of your expectations are. Discuss how your team will communicate throughout the quarter and consider how you will communicate respectfully should conflicts arise. By including each member’s name above and by adding their name to the submission, you are indicating that you have read the COGS108 Team Policies, accept your team’s expectations below, and have every intention to fulfill them. These expectations are for your team’s use and benefit — they won’t be graded for their details.\n",

    "* *Team Expectation 1* : We will use WeChat as our main channel (and email for formal messages). We respond within 24 hours on weekdays (and will send a quick acknowledgement + ETA if we’re busy).\n",
    "* *Team Expectation 2* : We will meet at least once per week (virtually on WeChat) for progress updates and planning. Each member will come prepared with: what they completed, what they’re doing next, and any blockers.\n",
    "* *Team Expecation 3* : All work will be tracked in a shared task list. Each task has a clear owner, deliverable, and deadline, and we update progress regularly so everyone can see what’s happening.\n",
    "* *Team Expecation 4* : We will divide work evenly by effort, and ensure everyone contributes to (1) defining/refining the research question + dataset choice, (2) coding/analysis, (3) writing explanations, and (4) editing/review—not just one person doing all the coding or writing.\n",
    "* *Team Expecation 5* : If a member is struggling to deliver, they will notify the group as soon as possible (ideally 48+ hours before a deadline). The team will respond by pairing up, adjusting scope, or redistributing tasks early rather than waiting until the last minute.\n",
    "* *Team Expecation 6* : We will communicate respectfully using “I” statements and specific feedback (e.g., “I think X is an issue because Y—what do you think?”). If conflict persists, we will discuss it in a meeting, agree on a concrete plan, and follow up at the next check-in."
