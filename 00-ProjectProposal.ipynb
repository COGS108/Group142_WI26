    "To study whether higher multi-year average PM<sub>2.5</sub> predicts higher adult COPD and asthma prevalence (by county) while controlling for other factors, we would construct an ideal dataset with Each County contains the following features. And we plan to collect 5 to 10 year datasets:\n",
    "- Air Pollution Exposure: Multi-year average annual PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration (µg/m³) for each county.\n",
    "- Health Outcomes: Adult COPD prevalence (%) and adult current asthma prevalence (%) for the corresponding time period. These would ideally be age-adjusted prevalence estimates of diagnosed COPD and current asthma among adults (18+).\n",
    "\n",
    "We also have a set of comprehensive covariates for each county, including:\n",
    "- Smoking Rate: Adult smoking prevalence (%) as smoking is a major COPD risk factor.\n",
    "- Demographics: Population age distribution (e.g., % of population over 65), sex distribution, and racial/ethnic composition of the county. These factors control for population differences that affect disease prevalence.\n",
    "- Socioeconomic Factors: Indicators such as median household income, poverty rate, education level (% high school graduates), and unemployment rate. These help control for social determinants of health that could confound the pollution-health relationship.\n",
    "- Urbanicity: A measure of how urban or rural the county is (for example, a rural–urban continuum code from USDA). Urban counties may have different pollution levels and health care access than rural ones, so this needs to be accounted for.\n",
    "- Healthcare Access: Metrics reflecting access to care, such as the number of primary care physicians per 100,000 population or the percentage of adults without health insurance. This controls for differences in medical diagnosis and management of COPD/asthma across counties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of Observations: Ideally, all counties in the U.S. (≈3,142 counties) would be included to maximize statistical power and generalizability. Each county would be one observation (a cross-sectional dataset), since we are examining multi-year average exposure and current outcomes. If a panel design were considered, we could have multiple observations per county over time, but the question’s focus on a multi-year average suggests a single observation per county (using recent 5–10 year data). Thus, roughly 3,000+ observations would be needed, covering the entire United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Collection Methods: In an ideal scenario, all variables would be measured consistently over the same multi-year period\n",
    "\n",
    "- PM<sub>2.5</sub> Data Collection: Fine particulate pollution levels would come from a combination of ground monitors and satellite-derived models to ensure every county has an estimate. For example, the EPA’s Air Quality System monitors and modeled data (like CDC’s Environmental Public Health Tracking network) could provide daily PM<sub>2.5</sub> values, which are then averaged to an annual mean for each year and further averaged over 5+ years. This yields a stable multi-year mean for each county.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Health Outcomes: COPD and asthma prevalence data would come from large health surveys (such as CDC’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System) analyzed with small-area estimation techniques. A model-based approach can produce county-level prevalence estimates for COPD and asthma by combining survey data with census population characteristics. This was done, for instance, in CDC’s PLACES project, which provides county estimates for chronic diseases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Smoking and Other Covariates: These would be collected from reliable national sources. Smoking rates and other health behavior data could also come from CDC survey estimates (e.g., BRFSS via PLACES). Demographic and socioeconomic variables come from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS), which continuously collects data on population characteristics in every county. Urban/rural status can be assigned from USDA classifications, and healthcare access metrics can be obtained from health resource databases (e.g., HRSA’s Area Health Resources File). Each of these data sources covers all U.S. counties consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Organization: All the above data would be merged into one cohesive dataset keyed by a common identifier for counties (such as the 5-digit FIPS code). Each row would represent one county, and columns would include the PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure, health outcomes, and control variables. The data could be stored as a spreadsheet or CSV file, or in a relational database. For example, one might use a table with columns: County_FIPS, County_Name, State, PM25_avg, COPD_prev, Asthma_prev, Smoking_rate, Median_income, Poverty_rate, RUCC_code, PrimaryCarePhysicians_per100k, etc. This organized format makes it easy to run statistical analyses. We would ensure that the time frames align (e.g., pollution averaged over 2015–2019 and COPD/asthma prevalence around 2019–2020) so that the exposure precedes or coincides with the health outcome measurement. In summary, the ideal dataset includes all U.S. counties with a comprehensive set of variables collected over the last 5–10 years, cleaned and combined into a single analysis file.\n",

    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "> We considered that not every county has the same number of air quality monitoring stations during data collection. This could introduce bias because there are fewer PM2.5 monitoring stations in rural areas and more in urban areas.\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "> Both EPA monitoring stations and the CDC collect county level data that does not include personal identifying information, such as names or precise addresses, so the privacy risk is extremely low.\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "> To mitigate potential downstream biases, we considered incorporating a range of protective variables, such as race, income, and education level, rather than focusing solely on PM2.5 concentrations. In this way, we identified potential environmental injustices, reflecting the distribution of polluting infrastructure across different communities in the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "> Although the raw data is publicly available, our data cleaning and tables are securely stored in a private Github repository, accessible only to team members and relevant faculty. Furthermore, by using Git, we can track who modified the data. This not only ensures data security during the analysis process but also prevents data from being corrupted.\n",
    " - [ ] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    ">Our data will only be used during the project period in the Winter 2026 quarter, and will be deleted or archived after the grading is completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "> Our analysis focuses primarily on outdoor PM2.5 concentrations, but our county level environmental data cannot capture factors affecting indoor air quality, such as household dust or workplace secondhand smoke, which contribute to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma.\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "> We identified detection bias, meaning that not being diagnosed by a doctor doesn't necessarily mean not being sick. In counties with limited access to healthcare, despite people being exposed to high concentrations of PM2.5, the diagnosis rate of respiratory diseases is low, leading to data that falsely suggests that poorer counties are healthier than they actually are. To address this detection bias, we will incorporate income as a factor to adjust these underestimated figures back to their true levels.\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "> In this project, to ensure that our charts and statistics accurately reflect the data, we will maintain integrity by avoiding misleading presentations, including outliers, and avoiding truncated axes, etc.\n",
    " - [ ] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "> Our analysis is fully documented in Jupyter Notebooks, and the use of Git ensures that all modifications are recorded. Furthermore, we have listed all data sources to facilitate verification by the TA and ensure the reproducibility of our work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "> We understand that the variable of income might be misinterpreted as being linked to discrimination, but in our project, it is simply a factual statement reflecting the unfairness of social structures, and not intended to discriminate against any particular group.\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "> We will test whether the model performs as accurately in impoverished counties as it does in wealthy counties. If the model makes more errors in impoverished areas, we will honestly report this in our report and explain the reasons.\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "> We will use various metrics to evaluate the model. For example, we will look at R² to understand the extent of air pollution's impact on asthma.\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "> Linear regression clearly shows the meaning of each number, which makes it easy to explain, for example, how much the asthma rate changes when PM2.5 levels increase.\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "> We will include a \"Limitations\" section in the project and honestly state that this analysis primarily focuses on the relationship between air pollution and respiratory health, but does not consider other factors such as family genetics.\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "> Our results are based on past data, so we would like to remind viewers that this data may need to be updated if future air pollution patterns change.\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "> If we find that our analysis might mislead others, we will immediately update the content. We will also include a disclaimer stating that this is a school project and does not constitute any medical advice or policy recommendations.\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    "> We use Git to manage our projects, and if we find any incorrect analysis or faulty code, we immediately go back to the appropriate version.\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "> To prevent unintended use, we will add a disclaimer explaining that our project only shows correlation, not causation. In other words, for example, the fact that there are more cases of asthma in areas with poor air quality does not mean that poor air quality causes asthma."

For example, if you have selected a problem that involves implementing multiple neural networks, please state this so we can make sure you know what you’re doing and so we can point you to resources you will need to implement your project. Note that you are not required to use outside methods.\n",
